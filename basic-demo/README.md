# Basic Pink Demo Mod

A zero-brain-cell example mod for Zen Browser.  Zip this folder, import it under **Preferences â†’ Mods â†’ Import**, hit **Enable**, and watch the navbar go hot-pink.

Want a different color?  Crack open the mod settings and change the **Accent color** hex.

Thatâ€™s literally it.  Have fun. ðŸŽ¨
